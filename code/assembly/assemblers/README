There are two batch scripts for the canu assembly here since I tried two different assembly options. 
The first file: 01_canu_assembly.sh, contains default values for most options
The second file: 02_canu_assembly, uses the options recommended for highly heterozygous genomes. 
The third file: 03_canu_assembly uses default options using a smaller genome size
